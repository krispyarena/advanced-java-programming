Common Object Request Broker Architecture [CORBA]

    - Technology used to communicate two objects of heterogenous type.
    - Distributed object based system.

Benefits of CORBA:

    Platform and Language Independence
        Object can interact regardless of their environment or language.
    
    Standardised Communication
        IDL provides the common way to define interfaces.

    Maturity and Support
        CORBA has a long history and wide industry adoption.

Limitations of CORBA:

    Complexity
        Setting up and managing CORBA can be more difficult than simpler technologies like RMI

    Performance Overhead
        Communication overhead can impact performance for highly interactive applications.

Difference from RMI:

    Language Neutrality
        CORBA supports multiple language while RMI is JAVA-specific.

    Standardisation
        CORBA is an industry-wide standard, while RMI is JAVA-specific technology.
