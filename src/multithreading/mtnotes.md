Multithreading

    It allows computer to handle multiple tasks at once making it more responsive and efficient.

How It Works:

    1. Task Breakdown
        Program divides its work into smaller, self-contained tasks(threads).

    2. Thread Creation
        The program creates threads, each with its own set of instructions and resources.

    3. Thread Scheduling
        The operating system juggles multiple threads and decides which one gets to use the CPU at any given moment.

    4. Concurrent Execution
        Threads can run concurrently i.e. they can make progress even if they are not currently using the CPU.

    5. Task Completion
        Once a thread finishes its task, it signals completion and release its resources.


Benefits of Multithreading:

    1. Improved Responsiveness
        Programs can handle multiple tasks at once, making them feel more responsive to user input.

    2. Better Use of Resources
        Threads can take advantage of idle CPU time, maximising hardware utilisation.
